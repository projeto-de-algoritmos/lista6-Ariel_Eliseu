### [3d Center Of Mass](3d_center_of_mass/)
Calculate the Center of mass of all objects in 3d matrix.
Is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) project.

#### Problem
Center of mass (C.O.M.) is a very important information when you need to calculate the trajectory of a body receiving a force. How can we calculate a C.O.M. of any 3D projection? How much computing is necessary?

### Vocational Test
Uses the inversion count to indicate the possibility of a student choosing one of the courses based on their history.

Is a [Golang](https://golang.org/) project.
